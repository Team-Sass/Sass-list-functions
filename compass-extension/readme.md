Advanced Sass list functions
============================

Here are a couple of advanced Sass (SCSS) list functions you may or may not need in your projects. Including:

* `chunk()`: chunk list into size large lists
* `count-values()`: count the number of occurrences of each value of list
* `debug()`: returns list as a string
* `first()`: return first item in list
* `insert-nth()`: insert value at index
* `is-symmetrical()`: check if list is symmetrical
* `last()`: return last item in list
* `last-index()`: return last index of value in list
* `loop()`: shift indexes in list
* `prepend()`: prepend value to list
* `purge()`: remove all `false` and `null` values from list
* `remove()`: remove value in list
* `remove-duplicates()`: remove duplicate values from list
* `remove-nth()`: remove value at index
* `replace()`: replace value in list
* `replace-nth()`: replace value at index
* `reverse()`: reverse list
* `slice()`: slice list
* `sum()`: sum all unitless values in list
* `to-string()`: cast list as string (JS `.join()`)

Some functions depend on other functions. If you include functions individually, make sure to check for these dependencies in their respective docs.

If you ever need to use them in one of your pen at CodePen, just link to http://codepen.io/HugoGiraudel/pen/loAgq as an extra CSS resource. You'll have instant access to all functions.
